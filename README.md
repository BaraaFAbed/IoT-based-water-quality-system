# **IoT-based Water Quality Monitoring System - Embedded Systems Project**
This project was developed in Python on a Raspberry Pi 3. It integrates various sensors and communication protocols (I2C, analog, UART, etc.), utilizes Flask to create a simple website hosted on the Raspberry Pi 3, and employs a rule-based fuzzy logic algorithm to assess water quality.
