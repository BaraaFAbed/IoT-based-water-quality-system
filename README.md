# **IoT-based Water Quality Monitoring System - Embedded Systems Project**
This project was developed in python on a raspberry pi 3. It includes the use of different sensors and communication protocols (I2C, Analog, UART, etc), the use of Flask to create a simple website hosted from the RPi 3, and the use of a rule-based fuzzy logic algorithm to assess the quality of the water.
